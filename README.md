# Project: Generate TV Scripts
## My 3rd Project in the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation

### Project Overview
In this project, I generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used a part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network I built generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the file [**helper.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/tv-script-generation/helper.py) and [**problem_unittests.py**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/tv-script-generation/problem_unittests.py) as well as the [**Moes Tavern Lines**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/tv-script-generation/data/simpsons/moes_tavern_lines.txt) from the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb```
